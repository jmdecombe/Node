- REPL is not working right
- use (function() { ... })(); to create a new variable scope
- use git --version, config, init, add, commit, diff, checkout, remote, push, pull, fork, clone, branch, fetch, merge
- use pages.github.com to host web pages related to organization or projects
- listen to events sent by emitters, such as streams returned as HTTP server responses
- use socket as duplex stream, writing to or reading from it
- use HTTP request to fetch properties (header, query) and response to return data (header, body)
- leverage stream nature of both request and response
- update npm with npm install npm -g
- use npm help, install (--save), ls, whoami, adduser, publish, view, version, dist-tags, outdated, update, rm/uninstall (--save)
- create account at npmjs.com
- read about semantic versioning at http://semver.org
- functions are objects inherited from Function.prototype, so can be added properties, etc.
